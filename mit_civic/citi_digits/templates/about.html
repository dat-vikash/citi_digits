        <p class="about-body">
            The Local Lotto tool is a visualization of the spatial patterns of the lottery in New York City.
            The interactive map allows users to understand where people are winning and losing money from the lottery,
            while also learning about the social demographics of those neighborhoods. It is a site for discussion about
            how the lottery affects local communities.<p>
        <p class="about-body"> This tool is part of the Local Lotto curriculum, a high-school-level module that uses the
        theme of the state lottery to teach mathematical concepts in data analysis and probability and to explore social issues surrounding the lottery.</p>
        <p class="about-body">
         Local Lotto is the first module of the City Digits project, an effort to develop place-based curricular modules that investigate and analyze specific themes related to the local, urban context to support high school students’ learning of mathematics. The curricular modules are enhanced by the integration of geo-spatial technologies, like the Local Lotto tool, which enable students to explore their local urban landscape, collect field data, and organize and visualize patterns.

        <p class="about-header"><span class="underline">Where does your data come from?</span></p>
        <p class="about-body">
            Demographic and household income is from the 2010 Census. All lottery data is from the NYS Lottery for 2010.
            Winnings data represents winning tickets of $5,000 or more, geo-coded by retailer store. Sales data represents
            total sales at a retailer store. We are also using a modified version of the <a href="http://www.infoshare.org/">Infoshare Neighborhood</a> file.
            Base data was obtained from Open Street Maps and New York City Building Footprints, Roadbeds, and Subway
            Entrances come from <a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/browse?tags=doitt%20gis">New York City Department of Information Technology and Telecommunications (DOITT)</a>.

        <p class="about-body"><a href="http://www.civicdatadesignlab.org/">MIT Civic Data Design Lab</a>, <a href="http://www.brooklyn.cuny.edu/web/home.php">
            Brooklyn College</a>, and the <a href="http://welcometocup.org/">Center for Urban Pedagogy</a> collaborated
            to create Local Lotto as part of a three year project to conduct urban investigations with youth to promote
            science and math literacy in New York City. MIT’s Civic Data Design Lab collected the data, worked to
            geographical represent the information, and develop and interactive interface. The whole project team
            worked toward the ultimate design directions and use scenarios of the tool.
